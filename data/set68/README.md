# Set68 for Image Denoising

In this folder you can find the Set68 evaluation set for image denoising algorithms. These images were directly downloaded from [DnCNN repository](https://github.com/cszn/DnCNN/tree/master/testsets/BSD68), and are a subset of the [Berkeley Segmentation Dataset](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/bsds/)
